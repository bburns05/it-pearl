                <div class="post-content">
                  <p>Located just off of Arkansas 124, tucked amongst the pines, the Museum is a half-acre of indoor antique displays housed in a unique architectural marvel.</p>
                  <p>Opened in 1964 by the then future Governor Winthrop Rockefeller, the museum still houses several of his personal automobiles along with cars owned or driven by other notable people such as Elvis Presley and President John F. Kennedy. It displays vehicles from as early as 1904 and as late as 1981, with 48 in between, in addition to motorcycles and pedal cars. Also on display is an antique gun collection and coin machines including a functioning player piano. With such a variety, there is something for everyone!</p>

                  <p> Facilities built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s are among America's most popular park facilities, and you'll understand why when you experience Mather Lodge.</p>
                  <p>Choose from 24 guest rooms or the park's cabins that are near the lodge. The westward view across the canyon is highlighted by a dramatic sunset each evening.We have designated lodge rooms that are dog friendly. Additional pet fees and shot records are required.</p>
