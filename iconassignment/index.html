<h1>3 takeaways:
<ul>
    <li>Lossless is a filter that compresses the data from an image, it doesn't lose the quality but it has to be uncompressed through a software like photoshop before using it again.</li>
    <li> Using image optimization plugins are very helpful for wordpress websites. This can help reduce the stress off the web server since you donâ€™t have to reload it everytime. </li>
    <li>A gif only uses 256 colors, and supporters animated images.</li>
</ul>
